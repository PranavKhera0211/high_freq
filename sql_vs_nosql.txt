You are asked to write up to 500 words to compare SQL and NoSQL databases, especially in connection
with the storage and processing of high-frequency finance data. 

Instructions

- NoSQL preferred for large data
- can focus on few key differences to stay within 500 words
- Can also use a table (but must stay in limit)
- assessed on contents, clarity and explanations
- answer the question exactly as asked
- Talk about ACID properties of databases
- Why NoSQL is better for big data

Outline

SQL (Structured query language)

- Relational data
- SQL perform well for conplex queries and systems needing data consistency 
- Vertical scalability (so struggles for large data)
- Table based (strictly define schema) - good for structured, relational data eg. inventory management
- Must organise + structure data before starting SQL database
- Prioritises ACID properties (atomicity - all transactions must succeed or fail entirely, consistency - rules against corruption at any step, isolation - transactions cannot afffect one another, durability - transactions are final)

NoSQL (Not only SQL)

- Horizontal scalability ie. can add servers/nodes so can handle more data and high speed workloads

- Don't need to preprocess data as much
- Good for real-time data processing
- Frequent changes in data structures
- JSON
- column oriented, key value stores, document stores - large unstructured data or logs, graph databases
- Prioritises CAP theory (consistency - each request each gets most recent result or an error)
